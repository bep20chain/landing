    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px;">What Is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Cryptocurrency is digital money designed to be secure, decentralized, and borderless. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (called "fiat" currencies), cryptocurrencies are maintained by a decentralized network of computers using blockchain technology.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
      Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most well-known. Since then, thousands of other coins and tokens—like Ethereum, Solana, and USDT—have emerged with various use cases including smart contracts, payments, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
      The key innovation behind cryptocurrencies is the blockchain: a public, immutable ledger that ensures transparency and security without the need for a central authority.

  <div style="max-width: 960px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 30px;">Core Concepts Explained</h2>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: bold;">🔗 Blockchain Technology</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      A blockchain is a distributed database shared among nodes in a network. It ensures that transactions are transparent, secure, and irreversible. Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a secure chain. No central server means no single point of failure.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: bold;">💱 Buying & Selling Crypto</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      You can buy crypto on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. Always enable 2FA and avoid sharing private keys. Selling involves converting back to fiat or stablecoins like USDT, often with small fees. Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is another option, but it carries higher risk if not done through reputable platforms.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: bold;">🔐 Wallets & Security</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Crypto wallets store your private keys — the credentials you need to access and manage your funds. Hot wallets (online) are convenient, but cold wallets (offline hardware) offer the best security. Never share your seed phrase. Backup everything securely and never email it to yourself.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: bold;">🧠 Avoiding Scams</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Scams are rampant in crypto. Common red flags include promises of guaranteed returns, impersonation of influencers, and urgent withdrawal requests. Use only trusted wallets and exchanges. Bookmark official sites and always verify links.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: bold;">🚀 DeFi & NFTs</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Decentralized Finance (DeFi) allows users to lend, borrow, and earn yield without banks. NFTs represent unique ownership of digital assets, from art to music to game items. Both are growing industries built entirely on blockchain technology.
